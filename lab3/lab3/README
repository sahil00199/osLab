*  There is a lab3.pdf which contains the problem statement.

*  There are two parts in this lab. Check the deadlines of the 
   two parts, and refer the given refrences and man pages for
   more details.

*  Also we have provided the sample turtle binary to understand
   the working of the shell.

*  Here are some sample testcases for part2, turtle, which you 
   should try on your shell. Try running these on the provided 
   binary first to understand what is happening.

*  In addition to these you should try your own testcases and 
   submit them.

*  Some commands with sample output.

   turtle>mkdir test

   turtle>ls
   make-tokens.c  turtle  turtle.c README test

   turtle>cd test
   
   turtle>pwd
   /home/cs333/labs/lab3/test
   
   turtle>cd ..

   turtle>pwd
   /home/cs333/labs/lab3

   turtle>cd
   Wrong number of arguments

   turtle>rm test
   rm: cannot remove 'test': Is a directory
   Error

   turtle>rmdir test

   turtle>ls
   make-tokens.c sample-output turtle turtle.c README 

   turtle>sleep 5

   turtle>echo "Hello"
   "Hello"

   turtle>echo "Hello" > hello.txt
   
   turtle>ls
   hello.txt make-tokens.c  sample-output  turtle  turtle.c README

   turtle>cat hello.txt
   "Hello"

   turtle>cd hello.txt
   Some error

   turtle>cat hi.text 
   cat: hi.text: No such file or directory
   Error

   turtle>sleep 5 ;; cat hello.txt ;; sleep 1 ;; echo "hi" ;; ls
   "Hello"
   "hi"
   hello.txt make-tokens.c  sample-output  turtle  turtle.c README

   turtle>cat hi.txt ;; echo "You know nothing Jon Snow"
   cat: hi.txt: No such file or directory
   Error
   "You know nothing Jon Snow"

*  Some more commands that you should try:
   cd .
   cd ..
   cd xyz (directory which doesn't exist)
   cat abc.txt
   sleep 10 
   echo "Hello World" > abc.txt
   cp abc.txt def.txt
   cat abc.txt > xyz.txt
   sleep 1 ;; echo "Hello" ;; sleep 2 ;; cat abc.txt ;; sleep 3 ;; ls -l

*  pipes.c and dup.c are sample programs for pipe and dupe system calls.
   This is for self study, and no submission is required.
